This package is for calculating heat transfer between homogenous dielectric bodies using the boundary element method.

Usage:
transfer <x3d file for body 1> <x3d file for body 2> <scale factor applied to x3d files (in meters)> <txt file containing lines of frequenies (in eV))

The executable `transfer-mpi' assumes the following files exist in the current directory:
body1.x3d
body2.x3d
a.txt
gaps.txt
freqs.txt

This simple input model is used for MPI to avoid issues with argument parsing and filesystems on mutiple nodes.

Both executables write the results to the file `./output', which contains lines:

<scaling factor (in meters)> <gap (in meters)> <T1 (in K)> <T2 (in K)> <f (in eV)> <spectral power (in W/eV)>


Requirements
============

  POSIX systems (e.g. Linux, OS X):
  ---------------------------------

  You need at least to have libtool installed to be able to build the
  library with "./configure && make".

Compiling
=========

  Call './configure && make' on the console to compile the library, all
  tools and demo applications, documentation and install them with
  'make install'. The latter has to be called as root.

  If you are compiling from CVS you have to call 'make -f Makefile.cvs'
  to generate all autotools build files before calling
  './configure && make'.

  You can use 'make distclean' and probably 'make -f Makefile.cvs clean'
  to clean up everything again. The latter will also delete all automatic
  generated autools build files.
